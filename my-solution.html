This is a .html file containing the improved .js code for the Shopify application.

/***********************************************************************
				Improvements - Fixed code will follow
 ***********************************************************************
(1) Fixed assignment operator = to conditional equality ==

(2) Fixed the <else if> for the default payment info to <else>

(3) Accessing the <getCardType> property without () will return the 
	function definition instead of the card_type value. Fixed to <getCardType()>
	
	Since the other properties of order are public variables, card_type should be 
	public as well for consistensy, unless there was a reason for it to be private. 
	(i.e. security)

(4) Lines that were too many columns wide were moved for cleaniness

(5) Grammar improvements:
		Added a two spaces before and after product name, 
		Added periods after " has been received." and " was charged $__."
		replaced the <p> with a space before " was charged ",
		moved "$" in front of the value.

(6) Only the last four digits of a credit card number should display on screen

(7) Added transaction number and order date.

(8) Other possible improvements:
	* The customer's account is not charged until the product is shipped
	* Delivery info, or estimated shipping date 
	* Letting the user know they should expect an email when the item ships
	* A table to display multiple product names, quantity, and item price
	* How the final total was calculated using: 
		item price, subtotal, GST, HST, promotional savings, and shipping fees
	* Billing address and delivery address
	* Shipping service used
	* Printer friendly page
